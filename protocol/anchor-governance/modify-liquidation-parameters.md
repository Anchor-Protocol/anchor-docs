# Modify Liquidation Parameters

The **Modify Liquidation Parameters** poll type allows Anchor governance to calibrate parameter values that control the mechanics of collateral liquidation. 5 parameters `Safe Ratio`, `Bid Fee`, `Max Premium Rate`, `Partial Liquidation Threshold`, and `Valid Price Timeframe` constitute the control mechanism of liquidating collaterals.

The `Safe Ratio` is the target risk ratio of a liquidated loan position, defined as the ratio of \(Borrow Amount\) to \(Borrow Limit\). A low `Safe Ratio` value allows for the fast liquidation of collaterals while incurring a high price impact for the collateral, while a low `Safe Ratio` value enforces liquidations with lower collateral price impact, albeit with slower collateral liquidation.

The `Bid Fee` parameter determines the commission rate on executed bids, which is used to purchase ANC tokens.

The `Max Premium Rate` is the maximum rate of premium that bidders can submit. 

`Partial Liquidation Threshold` is defined as the threshold total collateral value to trigger partial collateral liquidations. Loan positions with a total collateral value below this threshold have their collaterals fully liquidated at once, resetting their risk ratio to 0.

`Valid Price Timeframe` determines the freshness limit for oracle price data. Oracle price data is considered invalid \(halts all collateral liquidations\) when the most recent price data is older than `Valid Price Timeframe`.
