# ANC - UST LP Staking

High exchange liquidity of ANC tokens is crucial for retaining strong deposit rate stability via ANC-incentivized borrowing. It is also critical for Anchor Governance, as a low ANC exchange liquidity enables malicious entities to gain a sufficient supply of ANC and manipulate governance poll results.

As such, a small portion of the ANC supply have been allocated on protocol genesis as incentives for users that provide exchange liquidity to ANC tokens, specifically to the **ANC-UST Terraswap pair**. ANC incentives for ANC liquidity providers are distributed through the use of Terraswap Liquidity Provider tokens.

Terraswap's Liquidity Provider tokens, or **LP Tokens**, are minted uniquely to each exchange pair type and represent a liquidity provider's share of liquidity contribution to the pair. Anchor measures the degree of ANC liquidity contribution by distributing ANC rewards pro-rata to the amount of ANC-UST LP tokens staked to the protocol.

ANC rewards are accrued to LP stakers on a per-block basis, which they can later submit a request to claim. The **Dashboard** section of Anchor WebApp's **GOVERN** page includes an interface for liquidity providers to stake LP tokens and accrue rewards.

The **ANC - UST LP** section of the **GOVERN** page displays:

* **APY**: Annualized percentage yield (APY) of liquidity rewards given to ANC-UST LP token stakers.

* **Total Staked**: Total number of ANC-UST LP tokens staked by all users.
