# Anchor Token \(ANC\)

The **Anchor Token** \(**ANC**\) is Anchor Protocol's governance token. ANC tokens used as a deposit to create new governance proposals, which can be voted by users that have staked ANC.

ANC tokens are also used to bootstrap the initial borrow demand for the Anchor money market. ANC is distributed to borrowers, with the rate of distribution carefully controlled to ensure deposit rate stability.

ANC is designed to benefit its stakers with increasing adoption of Anchor Protocol; stakers of ANC are incentivized to vote for proposals that further merit the protocol.

## Value Accrual to ANC

ANC rewards can also be earned by staking LP tokens of the ANC &lt;&gt; UST Terraswap Pair.

ANC is designed to generate a buying pressure which increases proportionally with Anchor's assets under management \(AUM\). Terra stablecoins from below sources are used to purchase ANC tokens from the ANC &lt;&gt; UST Terraswap pair.

A part of the ANC tokens purchased from protocol fees are recollected as future borrower ANC incentives, prolonging borrower incentivization to persist even after the initial ANC allocation has been fully distributed.

### Protocol Fees

#### bAsset Rewards

A portion of rewards from deposited bAsset collaterals are used to purchase ANC, with the remainder used to replenish the interest buffer. The ratio of bAsset rewards used for ANC purchases can be adjusted thorough governance if the interest buffer's inventory rises to a sufficient level.

#### Deposit Rate Commission

Reserves accrued from the money market are also used to purchase ANC, effectively applying a commission to the deposit interest. This allows the value of ANC to scale with the deposit AUM.

#### Collateral Liquidation Fees

Whenever a loan is liquidated, 1% of the liquidated collateral value is used to purchase ANC.



### Governance Fees

ANC token deposits of Anchor governance polls that have failed to reach the required quorum are redistributed ANC stakers.

## Anchor Token Supply

There are planned to be a total of 1,000,000 ANC tokens to be distributed over a 4-year period. Beyond that, there will be no more new ANC tokens introduced to the supply.
