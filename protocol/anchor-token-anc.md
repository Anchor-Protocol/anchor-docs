# Anchor Token \(ANC\)

The **Anchor Token** \(**ANC**\) is Anchor Protocol's governance token. ANC tokens used as a deposit to create new governance proposals, which can be voted by users that have staked ANC.

ANC tokens are also used to bootstrap the initial borrow demand for the Anchor money market. ANC is distributed to borrowers, with the rate of distribution carefully controlled to ensure deposit rate stability.

ANC is designed to benefit its stakers with increasing adoption of Anchor Protocol; stakers of ANC are incentivized to vote for proposals that further merit the protocol.

### Deposit Rate Commission

Anchor Protocol uses a portion of Anchor's deposit interest to purchase ANC tokens from Terraswap, which are distributed pro-rata to stakers of ANC. The rate of commission, a value set by Anchor governance, creates a buying pressure that increases with the protocol's assets under management \(AUM\).
