# Modify Governance Parameters

{% hint style="warning" %}

The **Modify Governance Parameters** poll types allows for the creation of polls that alter Anchor governance-related parameters.

In order for a poll to pass, the poll must reach the `Quorum` and `Vote Threshold`. `Quorum` is the required minimum voter turnout for this poll, where more than `Quorum` portion of all staked ANC should have voted for this poll, whether the vote is `yes` or `no`. `Vote Threshold` is the required minimum percentage of `yes` votes required for the poll to pass.

Votes can be cast to a poll only during the `Voting Period` since poll creation. To prevent fluctuations in the total amount of staked ANC from affecting a poll's `Quorum` calculation, users can snapshot the the current amount of staked ANC for the poll. The snapshot can occur within a `Snapshot Period` time \(number of blocks\) window before the poll's end, where votes made within this period automatically trigger the snapshot. Quorum calculation for the poll is done using the snapshotted staked ANC amount and not the amount of staked ANC at the end of the poll.

Proposals that have passed and is past the `Expiration Period` after its end can be set to an expired state, allowing the WebApp to improve the visibility of ongoing polls by filtering out proposals that have already passed.

Passed proposals that include a governance message \(used to updated protocol parameters\) require a `Timelock Period` of time before the included message can be executed. This is to give Anchor users enough to prepare for the changes introduced by the poll.

All poll submissions require a minimum ANC deposit of `Proposal Deposit`, used to prevent excessive poll creation. This deposit is returned to the poll submitter if the poll passes.
