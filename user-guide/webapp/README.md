## Obtaining Terra Stablecoins

Anchor's money market uses Terra stablecoins as their base denomination. Users must have a balance of Terra stablecoins before they can interact with Anchor.

There are several ways to obtain Terra stablecoins:

* Swapping Luna for Terra stablecoins
* Purchasing Terra stablecoins from an exchange

### Swapping Luna for Terra Stablecoins

Users can swap Luna or Terra stablecoins such as TerraKRW (KRT), or TerraSDR (SDT) for the desired Terra stablecoin through the Terra blockchain's native swap functionality. The swap feature can be accessed at the "Swap" page of [Terra Station](https://station.terra.money), the official Terra desktop wallet.

1\. Navigate to the "Swap" page by clicking it on the sidebar. It should display a page similar to:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/picture-11.png)

2\. Select the coin denomination to swap and the coin denomination to receive in the "Swap coins" section, found at the bottom of the page. The swap will be conducted based on the current "Terra exchange rate".

{% hint style="info" %}
The approximate spread and fee for performing the swap will be shown. The rules for determining the fees are covered in [Terra Docs](https://docs.terra.money/dev/spec-market).
{% endhint %}

3\. Click **\[Next]** and sign the transaction to complete the swap.&#x20;
