# Anchor Governance Staking

Anchor periodically distributes portion of ANC tokens purchased from protocol fees are distributed to ANC stakers to incentivize governance participation and decrease circulating ANC supply. The functionalities required to stake ANC are supported in the **Dashboard** section of the **GOVERN** page, enabling users to easily acquire and stake / unstake ANC tokens.

::: {note}
Unlike ANC rewards from UST borrowing or ANC - UST LP staking, rewards from governance staking do not have a separate claiming procedure but instead automatically claimed when a user unstakes.
:::

The **Anchor Governance Staking** section of the **GOVERN** page displays:

* **APY**: Annualized percentage yield (APY) of staking rewards given to ANC stakers.
