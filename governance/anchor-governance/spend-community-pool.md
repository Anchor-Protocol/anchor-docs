# Community Grants

The Anchor Community Pool is a reserve of ANC tokens owned by governance. The Anchor governance can create proposals of ANC token grants to fund community developments and contributors in the Anchor ecosystem.

The purpose of the grant is to empower ecosystem teams to build necessary tools and infrastructure that are not provided at the launch of the protocol. Projects that are value additive to the protocol and/or make user experience better such as the creation of new smart contract applications that enable greater access across more markets or dashboards and other tools for managing their assets on the Anchor Protocol are eligible for community grant funding. Any proposal for funding that is deemed acceptable by the community and passes a vote can receive funding from the community pool.
