## Burning bLuna to redeem Luna

1. Navigate to the **BURN** tab in the **bASSET** page. 



2. Select a burn method. **BURN** and **INSTANT BURN** each correspond to:

* **BURN**: Burn bLuna through the bLuna protocol and redeem Luna. Redeemed Luna can be withdrawn after the Terra blockchain's unbonding period. Redemption is done with the current bLuna exchange rate but requires at least 21 days and the redemption amount may be affected by validator slashing. 
* **INSTANT BURN**: Swap bLuna to Luna through Terraswap. This process is instant but may suffer from trade slippage and Terraswap commissions.



3. Enter the amount of bLuna to burn / instant burn or the amount of Luna and click the **\[Proceed\]** button to confirm.



4. Station Extension should prompt you to sign a transaction that contains the burn operation. Confirm the details presented and enter your password to sign.



5. Burn complete. In the case of **BURN**, redeemed Luna can be withdrawn at the **CLAIM** tab after a unbonding period of at least 21 days.
