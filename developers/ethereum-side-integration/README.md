# EthAnchor

Welcome to the developer documentation for Ethereum-side Anchor. This documentation outlines the tools to interact with Anchor Protocol using wrapped Terra USD \(UST\), an ERC20-compliant token representation of UST on the Ethereum blockchain.

Instead of depositing native UST to acquire Anchor UST \(aUST\), interest-accruing proof-of-UST-deposits, clients can deposit wrapped UST to Anchor's [Ethereum Wrapper Contract](ethereum-wrapper-contract.md) to receive wrapped aUST \(ERC20-compliant token representation of aUST on Ethereum\). By holding on to wrapped aUST, clients can accrue the interest generated on their wrapped UST deposits.
