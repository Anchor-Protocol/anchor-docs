# xAnchor Core

The xAnchor Core contract receives messages from the foreign chain (via the xAnchor Bridge), and forwards them to the AddressProxy contract. If needed, it will initialize a copy of the AddressProxy contract for any foreign address that doesnâ€™t have a corresponding proxy contract already deployed.
