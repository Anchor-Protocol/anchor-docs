# Text Proposal

Any proposal that does not fit the pre-listed proposals can be submitted as a **Text Proposal**. A text poll consists of a simple title that should describe the intention of the proposal, a short description of the proposal, and an optional field to include an external link. 

Given that the text poll smart contract only supports very short descriptions \(currently 64-bits\), it is advisable to include a more detailed description on an external link and then attach the link in the `Information Link` field.

|  | Description | Optionality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Title | Title of proposal | Required |
| Description | Short description of proposal | Required |
| Information Link | External link for further proposal rationale | Optional |
