The functionalities required to stake ANC are supported in the **Dashboard** section of the **GOVERN** page, enabling users to easily acquire and stake / unstake ANC tokens.

Unlike ANC rewards from UST borrowing or ANC - UST LP staking, rewards from governance staking do not have a separate claiming procedure but instead automatically claimed when a user unstakes.
