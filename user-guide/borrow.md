# Borrow

The Borrow page can be used to borrow Terra stablecoins from Anchor. The protocol requires users to provide bAsset tokens as collateral before making a loan.

Borrows can be made until the loan's loan-to-value \(LTV\) ratio reaches the MAX LTV, calculated based on collateral types, their prices, and deposit amount. Loans with a LTV ratio higher than MAX LTV can be liquidated, and thus it is important for borrowers to closely maintain their LTV ratios as changes in collateral prices may occur.
