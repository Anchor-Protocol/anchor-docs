# Text Proposal

Any proposal that does not fit the pre-listed proposals can be submitted as a **Text Proposal**. A text poll consists of a simple title that should describe the rationale of the proposal, a short description of the proposal, and an optional field to include an external link. 

Given that the text poll smart contract only supports short descriptions \(limited to 128 bytes\), it is advisable to attach an external link in the `Information Link` field which includes further rationale on the proposal.
