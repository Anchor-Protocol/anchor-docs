# Text Proposal

Any proposal that does not fit the pre-listed proposals can be submitted as a **Text Proposal**. A text poll consists of a simple title that should describe the rationale of the proposal, a short description of the proposal, and an optional field to include an external link.&#x20;

Given that the text poll smart contract only supports short descriptions (limited to 1024 bytes), it is advisable to attach an external link in the `Information Link` field which includes further rationale on the proposal.
