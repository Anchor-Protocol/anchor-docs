# Community Grants

The **Anchor Community Fund** is a reserve of ANC tokens owned by governance. The Anchor governance can create proposals of ANC token grants to fund community developments and contributors in the Anchor ecosystem.

The purpose of grants are to empower ecosystem teams to build necessary tools and infrastructure that helps Anchor Protocol to further mature. Projects that are value additive to Anchor and/or improve user experience are eligible for community grant funding. Great examples of eligible grants include, but not limited to: the creation of new smart contract applications that enable greater access to Anchor, or dashboards and other tools for managing assets on Anchor Protocol. Any grant proposal that passes a governance poll can receive funding from the community fund.&#x20;
