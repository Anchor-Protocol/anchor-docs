# Introduction

## What is Anchor?

**Anchor** is a decentralized finance \(DeFi\) protocol on the Terra blockchain that offers high & stable yields on stablecoin deposits, powered by steadily-generated staking rewards of various proof-of-stake \(PoS\) blockchains. PoS staking rewards are brought to Anchor via [Bonded Assets](protocol/bonded-assets-bassets/) \(bAssets\); tokenized representations of assets bonded in PoS with generated staking rewards distributed to its holders.

Any user that wishes to gain extra leverage on their portfolio can borrow stablecoins from Anchor by locking bAssets as collateral. Rewards generated from locked bAsset collaterals are used to subsidize the stablecoin deposit rate.

Deposited stablecoins are represented by [Anchor Tokens](protocol/money-market/) \(aTokens\). aTokens are redeemable for the initial deposit along with accrued interest, allowing interest collection to be done just by holding on to them. Anchor is structured to provide depositors with:

* **High, stable deposit APYs** from rewards of [bAsset collaterals](protocol/money-market/#borrowing-terra-stablecoins)
* **Instant withdrawals** through [pooled lending](protocol/money-market/#depositing-terra-stablecoins) of stablecoin deposits
* **Principal protection** via [liquidation](protocol/liquidations.md) of loans in risk of undercollateralization

Anchor is an open, permissionless protocol, meaning that any third-party application is free to connect and earn interest without restrictions. Through [Anchor.js](developers/anchor.js.md), developers can interact with Anchor using just a few lines of code.

Further documentation of Anchor Protocol is provided in the following pages.
